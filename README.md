# üßë‚Äçüç≥ hygen-cook

A composition tool for [hygen](https://www.hygen.io) templates. Allows you to compose and generate complex services from many small modular hygen generators.

## Introduction

Hygen is great for templating out small bits of boilerplate for specific use cases, but less than ideal for large complex projects with multiple different options. Hygen Cook aims to solve that issue by allowing you to define a recipe for that large complex project by combining multiple small generators in a specific shape and order.

## Recipes

A recipe is composed of two main sections, `ingredients` and `instructions`. Ingredients specifies which generators will be used in the recipe, either by git url or npm package name. Instructions specifies the calls to those generators and the arguments they require. When you have a recipe file and want to cook the recipe, simply call `hygen-cook` and pass it the recipe, pretty soon you'll have a freshly baked project to start working on.

## Usage

### Install

To get the `hygen-cook` command available in your terminal you'll need to install the module globally:

```shell
npm i -g hygen-cook
```
